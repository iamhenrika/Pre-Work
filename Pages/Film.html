        Films reach a place in us that few other forms of art touch.
        The really great ones, not only stay with us but stand the test of time. Take for example <span class="red"> "The Wizard of Oz." </span>
        What was so special aboout a little girl from Kansas getting lost in an imaginary world?
        Nothing and everything. The idea that we see our lives and home as something boring, but forced for enough time to stay away we'd do everything in our power get to back there.
        Films like that speak to us on a level that touch our souls.
        For that reason and so many others I love classic film. I mean it's truly one of my greatest loves in life.
        A truly great film can inspire, can make you cry from heartache or joy or just make you forget where you are for 90 minutes.

        My love affair with film has led me to consume, appreciate and revere it. 
        I love it so whole heartedly that it only seems fair to share my love for them with the world.
        There's just something special about a well-made film. It stays with you for a reason.

        *Okay, now even though that little video says it's been 100 years of American film history it was done in 1994, so it's more like 128 years. Kind of amazing, don't you think?
